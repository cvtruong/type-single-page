I chose the Condor type face because it looked really simple and clean. The creator of Condor said he took inspiration from industrial cities. When I think of industrial cities, I think of the olden days. That's why I went with the color choice of black and white. I also added a touch of yellow/gold color for some of the lettering because another inspiration of the type face is art deco. A new thing I learned is css grid. It was confusing at first but it got really fun afterwards. It was fun to make the rows and positioning the letters by the grid. My favorite detail of the site is the infustrial city at the bottom and the smoke tower going up the page and how the header is "smoke" coming from the tower.
